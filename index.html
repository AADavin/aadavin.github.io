<div dir="ltr"><strong>Lakes Fuji Trip (OCTOBER 8th 10月8日)</strong></div>
<div><em>Let's explore the Mount Fuji area together!</em></div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>Saturday</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>Departure from Busta Shinjuku:</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong><br /></strong>Itinerary:<br /><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/P77qr1Fn8spw1dGt6" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/P77qr1Fn8spw1dGt6&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664781034943000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gNii2IS2ENORz9C_224s0">https://goo.gl/maps/P77qr1Fn8s<wbr />pw1dGt6</a><br /><br />Shinjuku stations is HUGE. It is easy to get lost there. So make sure you arrive with plenty of time. The departure is at 7:55 am. I will be there at 7:30 am</div>
<div dir="ltr">We arrive at Kawaguchiko eki at 9:40</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong><em>PLAN A:</em></strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">We spend the whole day hiking, going to mount&nbsp;<strong>Mitsutoge.</strong> This is a long hike, be prepared!</div>
<div dir="ltr">* <strong>Wear good shoes</strong>, and bring water and some snacks if you need extra energy. It might be <strong>muddy</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">More info here -&gt; (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/yamanashi/mount-mitsutoge-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/japan/yamanashi/mount-mitsutoge-trail&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664781034943000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kP_3rWSr2xofBpWXXBIFu">https://www.alltrails.com/tra<wbr />il/japan/yamanashi/mount-mitsu<wbr />toge-trail</a>)</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong><em>PLAN B:</em></strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">If the weather is very bad and it is very rainy, we might decide to do something slightly different, like walking along the lakes. In any case, anything else that we do will be easier (not harder), than mount Mitsutoge (which is not particularly hard either, it seems easier than Nokogiriyama.</div>
<div dir="ltr">******</div>
<div dir="ltr">After this,&nbsp;<strong>you can go back to Tokyo if you want,</strong> or you can sleep somewhere around the area, as I am planning to do (with other people)</div>
<div dir="ltr"><strong>Everyone is responsible for their own accommodation! Please find something around Fujiyoshida.</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">If you want me to find a hotel/hostel with you, please contact me in advance. I will try to find a place close to&nbsp;<strong>Chureito Pagoda</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>From Fujiyoshida we can take some great pictures of Mount Fuji<br />
<div><br /><strong>Sunday</strong></div>
<div><br />We are going very early to<strong>&nbsp;Chureito Pagoda.</strong>&nbsp;I am planning to wake up for sunrise, or close! Remember this is one of the last times that it will be possible to visit such an incredible place with few tourists!<br /><br />And after that, we stroll along the lakes to visit the<strong>&nbsp;Iyashinosato Historic Village</strong>, while enjoying a walk in the Nature<br /><br />We will go back to Tokyo on<strong>&nbsp;Sunday afternoon!</strong></div>
